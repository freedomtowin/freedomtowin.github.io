<h1>Train a Robust Classifier using a GPU</h1>

<p>This <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AptayjRoDITNLmyfCc0T7z_xKFBlg2l-">notebook</a> shows the optimization of a multi-class, linear support vector machine using a simulation based optimizer. Any simulation based optimizer could be used with the cuda kernel in this notebook. I used KernelML, my custom optimizer, in this example. The runtime for this script should be set to use the GPU: Runtime->Change runtime type.</p>

<p>The original SVM formulation can be found in this paper: <a href="https://www.svms.org/training/BOGV92.pdf">Vapnik 1992</a>. There have been advances to the robustness of the algorithm since then. Please see <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/Machine%20Learning%20under%20a%20Modern%20Optimization%20Lens/Robust_Classification.pdf">Robust Classifier 2019 section 6.1</a>. The robust impementation looks very tedious to implement. If you are interested in implementing it, please consider emailing me as well as looking at KernelML’s documentation.

<p>SVM are typically optimized using Langrage multiplers and quadratic programming. However, this optimization process might not be fast enough, and we want to utilize GPUs. :) We will optimize the SVM primal form with brute force methods. Actually, using a simulation based approach is not such a bad idea because the computational complexity of training an SVM is O(N³), where N is the number of data points.</p>

The loss function penalizes incorrectly classified data points by the distance to the class margin. The margin penalty, C, is constrained to C>0. The target, y, contains either -1 or 1, where 1 represents the target class. Please see the graphic below for a visual representation of the maximum margin linear decision function.

<p>The Iris dataset was used to test the feasibility of using a GPU for simulated based optimization. The dataset has 150 rows and 4 columns. It is a small dataset, but the optimization procedure seems to work. The optimizer's documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/freedomtowin/kernelml/blob/master/README.md">here</a>  and the cpu parallel implementation of this algorithm can be found <a href="https://github.com/freedomtowin/kernelml/blob/master/kernelml-support-vector-machine.py">here</a> .</p>
